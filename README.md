# Printed Web 6 (2018)

Printed Web 6 is the final issue of [Printed Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_the_Printed_Web#Printed_Web "Wikipedia: Library of the Printed Web"). It's [queer.archive.work](https://queer.archive.work), edited by [Paul Soulellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Soulellis "Wikipedia: Paul Soulellis"). It launches at the NY Art Book Fair in September and the Boston Art Book Fair in October. This moment closes out one project, and starts a new one — the beginnings of a radical, queer archive (as yet unnamed)!

* It’s a signal sent out into muddy waters; 
* It’s the start of a speculative practice emerging from (moving into?) the undercommons — a collective place for subversive artists and writers who reject normative narratives;
* Printed Web 6 is an assembling of queer methodologies ... 
* ... with a particular view towards network culture, failure, and refutation; 
* It’s an attempt to move far beyond the printed web;
* It’s an experiment in publishing as artistic practice as resistance.
